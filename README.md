# slopdocs

An agent skill for the [slopdocs](https://slopdocs.dev) convention. Teaches your coding agent to keep its planning docs, bug investigations, and feature write-ups in your repo where the next agent can find them.

## Install (OpenCode)

Add to your `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["slopdocs@git+https://github.com/ryanskidmore/slopdocs.git"]
}
```

Restart OpenCode. The `slopdocs` skill is now available and will be loaded automatically when the agent is writing or deciding whether to create documentation.

## Manual install

Copy `skills/slopdocs/SKILL.md` into your project:

```
.opencode/skills/slopdocs/SKILL.md
```

Or for cross-tool compatibility:

```
.agents/skills/slopdocs/SKILL.md
```

## What it does

The skill teaches your agent the slopdocs convention:

- **`slopdocs/features/`** - one living doc per feature
- **`slopdocs/bugs/`** - date-prefixed bug investigations
- **`slopdocs/plans/`** - date-prefixed implementation plans

It also tells the agent when a doc is worth writing (architectural decisions, non-obvious bugs, new features) and when to skip (renames, trivial changes, dependency bumps).
